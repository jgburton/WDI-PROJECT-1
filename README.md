## GA WDI Project 1
 
## Piano Memory Game - Lick Library

For the first porject on WDI I decided to build an octave piano memory game using html5 for content, CSS3 for styling and JavaScript using jQuery notation for functionaility.

###Approach to the build of Lick Library: <br>
1. Make a list to represent each piano key. <br>
2. Create audio files for each individual note, sampling an octave from middle C on the piano.<br>
3. Map appropriate audio to each key.<br>
4. Generate a random sequence, with musical notes and change keys in apperance by colour/styling.<br>
5. User must input the same sequence using computer keys.<br>
6. If the user input sequence is equal to the computer sequence increase sequence by one addtional random musical note.<br>
7. Play extended audio/visual sequence.
8. Repeat steps 5 and 6 if correct. Otherwise, alert 'fail' and promt to restart game.

Additional feature: Add a 'jam' function so the user can use the virtual piano freely.

###The completed game is deployed on Heroku:

###Wins
Using html, css and Java Script (jquery notation) to build a game from scratch.
Overcoming issues with functionality, particulary in gaining a better understanding of loops in JavaScript and setting up event listeners.
Experimenting with minimalist design for the application.

###Future Improvements: <br>
I'd like to add alternative audio, possibly having a few settings for different piano/keyboard samples for the 'jam' function and increase the size of the octave piano to two octaves incooperating the black (#/b) keys.

I'd also like to learn how to manipulate the length of audio without effecting the quality of the sound when pressing a key for a longer period of time. This would enable the user to play sustained chords while using the 'jam' function.

Making the web application responsive using CSS and setting up click events on the individual piano keys in addition to key down events for use on tablet devices.
